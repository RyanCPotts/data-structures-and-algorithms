Sorting: How We Decide the Order

When we want to put things in order, like numbers or names, we need to figure out which comes first. For example, when sorting numbers, it's easy: we just use basic comparisons like "is this number smaller?"

But what if we’re sorting more complex stuff, like a list of movies or books? We need a way to tell our sorting tool how to compare them. This is done with something called a "comparator." It’s like giving instructions on how to decide which item should come first.

Sorting Numbers:

We use a simple rule. If one number is smaller, it comes first. If it’s bigger, it goes later.

Sorting Words:

Sorting words can be tricky because of different languages and characters. But most programming tools have built-in features to help with this.

Sorting Objects:

If you’re sorting something like movies, you might want to order them by the release year or title. You can set rules for this, like ignoring “The” at the start of a movie title.

Assignment:

For practice, write some functions to sort movies by their release year and title, and then check to make sure your sorting works as expected.
